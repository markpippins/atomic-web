# Angular Throttler - Service Mesh Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides specific implementation steps to transform the Angular Throttler application into a comprehensive service mesh visualization and management platform.

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified

1. **Service Mesh Data Mixed with File System Navigation**
   - Host Server data is treated as file system nodes
   - Service instances are confused with host profiles
   - No real-time service monitoring

2. **Incomplete Service Registration**
   - Only Quarkus service auto-registers with Host Server
   - Spring Boot, Node.js, Python services missing registration

3. **Limited Service Visualization**
   - No service dependency graphs
   - No service health indicators
   - No service operation controls

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Service Mesh Models

Create `src/models/service-mesh.model.ts` with comprehensive interfaces for:
- ServiceInstance
- Framework
- ServiceDependency
- ServiceConfiguration
- ServiceMetrics
- ServiceUpdate

### Step 2: Implement Service Mesh Data Service

Create `src/services/service-mesh.service.ts` with:
- Real-time service polling
- WebSocket connections for updates
- Service operation execution
- Framework and dependency management

### Step 3: Create Service Mesh Components

#### A. Main Service Mesh Component
- Service statistics dashboard
- Toggle between tree and graph views
- Service operation controls

#### B. Service Tree Component
- Framework-grouped service listing
- Health status indicators
- Environment filtering
- Service action buttons

#### C. Service Details Component
- Comprehensive service information
- Configuration management
- Metrics display
- Dependency visualization

### Step 4: Update App Component Integration

Add service mesh mode toggle and conditional rendering between file explorer and service mesh views.

## Key Features to Implement

1. **Real-time Service Monitoring**
   - WebSocket connections to Host Server
   - Automatic service status updates
   - Health check monitoring

2. **Service Operations**
   - Start/Stop/Restart services
   - View service logs
   - Health check execution

3. **Service Visualization**
   - Framework-grouped tree view
   - Dependency graph visualization
   - Service metrics dashboard

4. **Multi-Framework Support**
   - Spring Boot services
   - Quarkus services
   - Node.js services
   - Python services
   - Go services
   - Helidon services

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Service models and data service
- **Week 3-4**: Service mesh components
- **Week 5-6**: Service graph visualization
- **Week 7-8**: Integration and testing

This plan will transform the Angular Throttler into a comprehensive service mesh management platform.
