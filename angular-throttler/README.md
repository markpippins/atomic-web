# Throttler - A Web-Based File Explorer

Throttler is a modern, web-based file explorer clone inspired by the Windows Explorer interface. It's built with Angular and features a dynamic, component-based architecture that allows for navigating both a mock local file system and a remote file system.

This version is a pure web application that runs in any modern browser.

## Key Features

- **Modern Angular:** Built with the latest standalone components, signals for state management, and zoneless change detection for high performance.
- **Virtual & Remote File Systems:** Seamlessly navigate and manage files across a virtual "Convex Pins" system and any number of user-configured remote servers.
- **Dual Pane View:** Toggle between a single or a split-view interface to manage files across two directories simultaneously.
- **Theming:** Choose between Light, Steel, and Dark themes to customize the user interface. The selected theme is persisted in local storage.
- **File Operations:** Supports creating files/folders, renaming, deleting, cut, copy, and paste on supported remote file systems.
- **Drag & Drop:** Upload files by dragging them from your desktop into the explorer.
- **Lasso Selection:** Click and drag in an empty area to select multiple items.
- **Details Pane:** A slide-out pane provides details and an image preview for the selected file.
- **Search:** Perform quick searches or open a detailed search dialog to find files within a file system.

## Running the Application

This is a web application built with the Angular CLI.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (or a compatible package manager) installed.

### 1. Installation

First, install the necessary dependencies from the project's root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will compile the application, start a development server, and open your default browser to the application, typically at `http://localhost:4200`. The server will automatically reload when you save changes to the source files.

### 3. Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
This will compile and optimize the application, placing the output in the `dist/` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to any static web hosting service.

### Optional: Running Backend Services

For full "Remote Connection" functionality, the application relies on a suite of backend microservices. Each should be run in its own terminal after being compiled from TypeScript to JavaScript (which the `ng build` or `ng serve` process handles).

1.  **File System Service:** Handles file operations for remote connections. The default server profile expects this to be accessible via the broker URL.
    ```bash
    node app/serv/file/fs-serv.js
    ```

2.  **Image Server:** Serves static and dynamically generated icons.
    ```bash
    node app/serv/image/image-serv.js
    ```
    _Note: There may be a duplicate `image-serv.ts` file in the `serv` root. This command refers to the one inside `serv/image/`._
    
The application is pre-configured with a "Local (Debug)" server profile that expects a broker at `http://localhost:8080` and the image server at `http://localhost:8081`.

The project also includes other backend services that are not fully integrated into the UI but can be run for development and testing:

- **Google Search Service:** This service acts as a proxy to the live Google Custom Search API, powering the "Web Search" tab. To enable live results, you must create a `.env` file in the project root and add your credentials:
  ```
  GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_search_engine_id_here
  ```
  Then run the service:
  ```bash
  # Google Search Service (runs on port 8082)
  node app/serv/search/gsearch-serv.js
  ```
  **Note:** If the backend service is running but the API key and Search Engine ID are not provided in its environment, it will return an error. The frontend application is designed to detect this specific error and will gracefully fall back to providing mock search results, ensuring the UI remains functional for all developers.

- **Unsplash Image Search Service (Mock):** This service returns mock data.
  ```bash
  # Mock Unsplash Image Search Service (runs on port 8083)
  node app/serv/unsplash/image-search.js
  ```
