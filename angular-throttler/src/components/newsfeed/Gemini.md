# `NewsfeedComponent` Documentation (`/src/components/newsfeed/Gemini.md`)

This is a simple presentational component designed to be displayed within one of the tabs in the `SidebarComponent`.

## Core Responsibilities

-   **Displaying Content:** Its sole purpose is to display a static list of "news" or "update" items.
-   **Placeholder:** It serves as a functional example of how different views can be embedded into the sidebar's tabbed interface. In a more complex application, this component could be enhanced to fetch and display dynamic data from a service.

## API and Data Flow

-   **Inputs:** None.
-   **Outputs:** None.
-   **Logic:** The component has no internal logic; its template (`newsfeed.component.html`) contains hardcoded HTML content.
