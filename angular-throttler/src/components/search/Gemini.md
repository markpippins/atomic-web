# `SearchComponent` Documentation (`/src/components/search/Gemini.md`)

This component provides a search interface within a dedicated tab in the `SidebarComponent`.

## Core Responsibilities

-   **User Input:** It provides a `textarea` for users to enter a search query.
-   **Simulated Search:** It includes a `search()` method that simulates an asynchronous API call (using `setTimeout`).
-   **State Management:** It manages the UI state during the search process, including disabling the search button and showing a loading indicator.
-   **Displaying Results:** It displays a list of mock search results upon completion of the simulated search.

## API and Data Flow

-   **Inputs:** None.
-   **Outputs:** None.

## Internal State (Signals)

-   `query: string`: Stores the current text from the search input field.
-   `isLoading: boolean`: A flag that is `true` while the simulated search is in progress. This is used to show a loading state in the UI.
-   `results: SearchResult[] | null`: Holds the array of search results. It is `null` initially and when a new search begins.

## Future Enhancements

This component is currently a placeholder. To make it functional, the `search()` method would be updated to call a real search service that interacts with a backend API.
